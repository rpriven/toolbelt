# Djedi Toolbelt

This script installs / updates some of the important key tools for Pentesters and Bug Bounty Hunters.  You probably
have most of these tools installed already (as it was designed for use with Kali/Debian/Ubuntu), but it is useful for 
me to have it all together in one script so I don't have to take the time to search for everything when I start a 
new VM or worry about installing everything manually.

**This installs a good amount of tools, if you are looking for something light, you may want to remove what you do not want or need before running the script.**
